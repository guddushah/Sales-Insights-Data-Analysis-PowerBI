## SQL Database dump file
- db_dump_version_2.sql
#### Tables in the Database
      - customers
      - dates
      - markets
      - products
      - transactions

## Steps for Project Execution
- Importing db_dump_version_2.sql dump file in MySQL
- Performing data analysis using SQL queries in MySQL for getting some insights from the database.
- Connecting Power BI to MySQL server for fetching the data from the database for doing ETL (Extraxt, Transform and Load).
- Reviewing the Database relationship created by Power BI by default and establishing new relationships between the tables.
- Data modelling is done by connecting different tables using a foreign key and primary key. In this project, Star Schema is used for Data Modelling where all the dimension tables are connected with Fact tables
- Using Power Query for data cleaning and transformation in Power BI.

## Data Analysis using SQL

## Key Measures Created using DAX Formulas
1. **Revenue** = SUM('sales transactions'[norm_sales_amount])
2. **Sales Qty** = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_qty])
3. **Total Profit Margin** = SUM('sales transactions'[profit_margin])
4. **Profit Margin %** = DIVIDE(SUM('sales transactions'[profit_margin]),[Revenue],0)
5. **Profit Margin Contribution %** = DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin],CALCULATE([Total Profit Margin],ALL('sales markets'),ALL('sales customers'),ALL('sales products')))
6. **Revenue LY** = CALCULATE([Revenue],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('sales date'[date]))
7. **Revenue Contribution %** = DIVIDE([Revenue],CALCULATE([Revenue],ALL('sales markets'),ALL('sales customers'),ALL('sales products')))
8. **Profit Target** = GENERATESERIES(-0.05, 0.15, 0.01)
9. **Profit Target Value** = SELECTEDVALUE('Profit Target'[Profit Target])
10. **Target Diff** = [Profit Margin %]-'Profit Target'[Profit Target Value]
